# Sudoku
Test-Sudoku is the main script. It depends on Pycosat_runner script to call pycosat. 
This project would require the Sudoku database from kaggle. The database should be extraced at the same location where the scripts are copied.
To start the default execution type 'run test_sudoku.py' from python prompt and call solveall().
Now wait and watch the magic in the folder where scripts are located.
